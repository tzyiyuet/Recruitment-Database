#1. Background
The recruitment process of a company is an essential step for hiring new employees who are most qualified. To have an efficient and effective process, the company will need to acquire a talent pool, a database to store the potential job candidates. Information on job applications will be stored as data. As the number of applications may be large, having a clean talent pool can offer the benefits of efficient data extraction to employers. The following sections emphasize the main functionalities of a talent pool. 

##1.1 Store Information of Applications
The recruitment process will first start from the employers by demonstrating the requirements of specific positions. To do so, employers will post job posts on their company websites or other job boards. Based on the post, such information will be stored, such as contact information and work experiences. 

##1.2 Sort Information into Subsets 
Once the posts have been posted, personal managers will start reviewing and comparing candidates. This will be a stage of data extraction by sorting and filtering. In this case, a large number of applications will be sorted out, remaining those who are qualified for further stages such as interviewing. These qualified candidates could be stored in a subset of the talent pool. In addition, the date of the interview will be saved as data. 

##1.3 Store Information of Interviews
The times of the interview can be varied from company to company. The information of each interview can also be stored in the talent pool for comparisons. 

##1.4 Update Information after Decisions Made
Based on all the input, personal managers will make the hiring decision, following by reference checks. Once the top candidate is identified, personal managers then notify the interviewees and the relevant managers about the decision. When a job post is closed, applicants of rejected applicants are retained in the archive for a specific period. If it is needed, a company will store the data of recruited employees as future references.
